## SquareIt

A very simple and moddable game, written in Python using pygame.

> It's in a very early stage, so there's not much to play right now ;)

## Play

Clone the repo, cd into the cloned folder and into the `Source` folder.
Then you just run:
`python Run.py`

<br>

## Screenshot

Here's a screenshot of how the game looks so far. The screen shot is a modded
version. The mod file / config file, can be found in: `Source/Game Mods/Test Mod.json`.
